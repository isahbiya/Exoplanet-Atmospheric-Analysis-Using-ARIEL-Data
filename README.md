# Exoplanet-Atmospheric-Analysis-Using-ARIEL-Data

Project Overview
This project aims to extract the chemical spectrum of exoplanet atmospheres from simulated data generated by the European Space Agency's Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey (ARIEL) mission. The goal is to enhance the understanding of exoplanet chemistry through analysis of observational data.

Dataset Components
The dataset comprises various files that include both metadata and signal data:

Metadata Files
ADC Information: Contains gain and offset parameters to restore the original dynamic range of the data.
Ground Truth Labels: Provides actual spectra for training and evaluation purposes.
Axis Information: Details about the axes of the instruments used.
Wavelength Grid: Information about the wavelengths for the spectra in the dataset.

Signal Files
AIRS-CH0: Data from the infrared spectrometer with a sensitivity range of 1.95 to 3.90 µm. Contains 11,250 frames of 32x356 images.
FGS1: Data from the Fine Guidance System, capturing 135,000 frames of 32x32 images at 0.1 second intervals.

Calibration Files
Dark Frames: Used to subtract thermal noise and bias levels.
Dead/Hot Pixels: Identifies non-responsive pixels and those with consistently high signals.
Flat Field Frames: Corrects for variations in pixel sensitivity.
Linearity Correction: Applies polynomial corrections for pixel response to varying light.
Read Noise: Captures electronic noise during the sensor readout process.

Processing Steps
Data Restoration: Multiply the signal data by the gain and add the offset from the ADC info to recover the original dynamic range.
Image Unflattening: Reshape the flattened data for analysis using numpy (e.g., numpy.reshape(11250, 32, 356) for AIRS-CH0).

Goals
Improve the extraction of atmospheric chemical spectra from low-photon, noisy data.
Utilize advanced calibration techniques to enhance signal quality.
Contribute to future astronomical studies through accurate spectral analysis.

Expected Outcomes
Provide insights into the chemical composition of exoplanet atmospheres.
Support ongoing astronomical research and the ARIEL mission’s objectives.
