# Exoplanet-Atmospheric-Analysis-Using-ARIEL-Data
This project aims to extract the chemical spectrum of exoplanet atmospheres from simulated data generated by the European Space Agency's Atmospheric Remote-sensing Infrared Exoplanet Large-survey (ARIEL) mission. The goal is to enhance the understanding of exoplanet chemistry through analysis of observational data.
